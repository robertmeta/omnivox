;;; omnivox-voices.el --- Define Omnivox voice parameters -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; Description:  Module to set up Omnivox voices and personalities
;; Keywords: Voice, Personality, Omnivox
;;
;; Omnivox is a cross-platform Emacspeak speech server written in Rust.
;; It supports macOS (AVSpeechSynthesizer), Windows (WinRT), and
;; espeak-ng as a universal fallback.  Rate uses a 0-100 integer
;; scale (50 = normal speed), divided by 100 server-side.

;;; Commentary:
;; This module defines the various voices used in voice-lock mode
;; by the Omnivox TTS engine.
;;
;; Self-registering: this file hooks into emacspeak automatically.
;; No need to modify emacspeak files.  Just add to load-path and
;; require before emacspeak loads:
;;
;;   (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/omnivox/elisp")
;;   (require 'omnivox-voices)
;;
;; Omnivox inline codes:
;;   [{voice <name>}]  -- switch voice (e.g. en-US:Alex)
;;   [[pitch <float>]] -- set pitch multiplier (1.0 = normal)
;;
;; Voice querying:
;;   Voices are queried from the omnivox executable at runtime via
;;   --list-voices-alist.  The available voices vary by platform
;;   and installed voice packs.
;;
;; Customization:
;;   M-x customize-group RET omnivox RET
;;   All settings are in the `omnivox' customization group.
;;
;; Settings are sent to the running omnivox process via protocol commands.
;; No environment variables needed (omnivox uses CLI flags instead).

;;; Code:

;;  Required modules:

(eval-when-compile (require 'cl-lib))
;; Support both emacsvox (new) and emacspeak (legacy) preambles.
;; emacsvox provides emacsvox-preamble; emacspeak provides emacspeak-preamble.
;; Both export ems--fastload and the same utility macros.

  "Configure TTS to use Omnivox.
Works with both emacsvox (the new fork) and emacspeak (classic).
Sends defcustom settings to the already-running omnivox process
via protocol commands.

emacsvox invokes the speech server as a plain subprocess with no
CLI args — all configuration happens here via the wire protocol.
omnivox must not rechunk the text it receives; emacsvox already
performs clause-level chunking before sending each `q {}' command."
  ;; --- Voice dispatch functions ----------------------------------------
  ;; emacsvox uses emacsvox-tts-* names; emacspeak uses tts-* names.
  ;; Both must be set because emacsvox-tts.el creates the defalias chain
  ;;   tts-get-voice-command → emacsvox-tts-get-voice-command
  ;; as an alias, not a live indirection.  fset on tts-* overrides the
  ;; alias without changing emacsvox-tts-*, so we set both explicitly.
