** What is it?

This is another Emacspeak server, but with a few unique properties.

Built on DECTalk which is presently the best voice server in terms of testing
with Emacspeak and supporting important Emacspeak features.

Created to always be building on Linux, Mac, Windows. Not just building but
with releases so that all that is required to run it is to download the
release bundle and extract it to your $EMACSPEAK/servers directory.

The goal is most uses will use the binaries.
